{"name":"Spiky","tagline":"","body":"*Spiky* is the code name for the next-generation spike-sorting software \r\nadapted to high-channel count silicon probes. Written in Python, it aims at \r\nbeing flexible and extendable by the user.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to create a new semi-automatic graphical interface\r\n(code name: *KlustaViewa*) for\r\nthe manual stage that comes after the automatic clustering algorithms.\r\nThis interface automatically guides the user through similar clusters,\r\nshowing the most relevant feature projections, and asks him or her to make merge or\r\nsplit decisions. The goal is to make the manual stage more reliable, less\r\nerror-prone and quicker than what it currently is.\r\n\r\nThis software was developed by Cyrille Rossant in the [Cortical Processing Laboratory](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab) at UCL.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe software is still in developpement, but you can download an experimental\r\nversion here.\r\n\r\n### Step 1\r\n\r\nIf you don't already have a Python distribution, install [Enthought Python Distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php) (EPD), which is free for academics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step 2\r\n\r\n[Download Spiky](http://spiky.rossant.net/spiky-0.1.0.dev.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step 3\r\n\r\nUnextract this ZIP file in a temporary folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step 4\r\n\r\n  * On Windows, double-click on `windows_install.bat`.\r\n  * On other systems, open a system shell in the temporary directory where\r\n    you extracted the package, and execute the following command:\r\n    `python setup.py install`.\r\n\r\n### Step 5\r\n\r\nTo run the software, execute `spiky` in a system shell.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, you may need to add `C:\\Python27\\Scripts` in the PATH variable,\r\nas [described here](http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx).\r\n\r\n\r\nGallery\r\n-------\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot 1](images/thumbnails/img0.png)](images/img0.png)\r\n[![Screenshot 2](images/thumbnails/img1.png)](images/img1.png)\r\n[![Screenshot 3](images/thumbnails/img2.png)](images/img2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation for advanced users\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n  \r\nThe following libraries are required:\r\n  \r\n  * Python 2.7\r\n  * Numpy\r\n  * Pandas >= 0.10\r\n  * Matplotlib >= 1.1.1\r\n  * PyOpenGL >= 3.0.1\r\n  * either PyQt4 or PySide\r\n\r\nThere are two possibilities to install these dependencies.\r\n  \r\n#### Use an all-in-one Python distribution\r\n\r\nAll these dependencies are included in the \r\n[Enthought Python Distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php) (EPD),\r\nwhich is free for academics.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Install all packages one by one\r\n\r\nThis solution can be useful if you already have a Python installation and \r\nonly a few packages are missing.\r\n\r\n  * On Windows, [find the packages on this webpage](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).\r\n  * On OS X, find them on [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) or [Macports](http://www.macports.org/)\r\n  * On Ubuntu, use `apt-get install` with the appropriate package name, which you can find [here](http://packages.ubuntu.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installer\r\n\r\n[Download Spiky](http://spiky.rossant.net/spiky-0.1.0.dev.zip), extract that package\r\nand execute `python setup.py install`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Development version\r\n\r\nUse this if you want to be able to update with `git pull` (you need git).\r\n\r\n  * Clone the repository:\r\n  \r\n        git clone https://github.com/rossant/spiky.git\r\n  \r\n  * Install Spiky with `pip` so that external packages are automatically\r\n    updated (like `qtools` which contains some Qt-related utility functions):\r\n  \r\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n  \r\n    ","google":"UA-6774000-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
