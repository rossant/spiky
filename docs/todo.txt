Keyboard shortcuts

  * Next/Previous cluster
  
  * Merge/Split
  
  * Automatic projection in FeatureView
  
  * Change channel in FeatureView
  
  * Toggle overlay in WaveformView
  
  * Toggle spatial arrangement in WaveformView
  
  * Change box/probe scaling in WaveformView
  
  




Metadata/user preferences: what to store in the data file, and in the user
preferences files? (eg waveform view scaling, arrangement, etc)



How to implement the automatic projection in the FeatureView?



Most efficient way of computing the correlograms?




TODO
----

  * keyboard shortcuts for probe/box rescaling in waveformview
  * P for automatic projection in feature view
  * featureview controller: buttons for channel up/down
  * cluster group renaming

  * channel selection in waveformview
  * function for automatic zoom in waveformview as a function of
    channels and clusters
  * feature view: toggle transparency (T)
  * feature view: toggle show/hide masked points
  * put COLORMAP in the data holder and remove dependencies 
  * correlograms computation
  * cluster merge with button / M press
  * cluster split with button / S press
  * trace view
  * lowlight: gray or original colors
  * transient recoloring
  * move data manager into templates, so that templates contain everything
  * force cleaning up of widgets upon closing
  * make sure the GUI work in IPython
