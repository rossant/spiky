Keyboard shortcuts

  * Next/Previous cluster
  
  * Merge/Split
  
  * Automatic projection in FeatureView
  
  * Change channel in FeatureView
  
  * Toggle overlay in WaveformView
  
  * Toggle spatial arrangement in WaveformView
  
  * Change box/probe scaling in WaveformView
  
  


Feature view

  * how to show mask (gray? transparency?) show it at all??

  * selection of masked spikes or not?
  

measure of cluster quality: ratio of mask/unmask on each channel
  

Metadata/user preferences: what to store in the data file, and in the user
preferences files? (eg waveform view scaling, arrangement, etc)



How to implement the automatic projection in the FeatureView?



Most efficient way of computing the correlograms?




TODO
----

  * number of spikes and highlighted spikes in a box, in the featureview

  * keyboard shortcuts for probe/box rescaling in waveformview
  * P for automatic projection in feature view
  * featureview controller: buttons for channel up/down
  * cluster group renaming
  * refactoring correlograms: put the actual computations outside dataio
  
  * lightweight hdf5 text viewer

  * channel selection in waveformview
  * function for automatic zoom in waveformview as a function of
    channels and clusters
    
  * [later] fetdim variable in controller widget (1 to ?)
  
  * bug in cluster view with auto scrolling
  * trivial mask if mask not provided
    
    
  * feature view: toggle between: everything colored, masked = gray, with transparency for fmask
  
  
  * put COLORMAP in the data holder and remove dependencies 
  * correlograms computation
  * cluster merge with button / M press
  * cluster split with button / S press
  * trace view
  * lowlight: gray or original colors
  * transient recoloring
  * move data manager into templates, so that templates contain everything
  * force cleaning up of widgets upon closing
  * make sure the GUI work in IPython
