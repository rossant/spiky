Keyboard shortcuts

  * Next/Previous cluster
  
  * Merge/Split
  
  * Automatic projection in FeatureView
  
  * Change channel in FeatureView
  
  * Toggle overlay in WaveformView
  
  * Toggle spatial arrangement in WaveformView
  
  * Change box/probe scaling in WaveformView
  
  * Reset view in WaveformView/FeatureView




Feature view

  * how to show mask (gray? transparency?) show it at all??

  * selection of masked spikes or not?
  

Measure of cluster quality: ratio of mask/unmask on each channel
  

Metadata/user preferences: what to store in the data file, and in the user
preferences files? (eg waveform view scaling, arrangement, etc)



How to implement the automatic projection in the FeatureView?



Most efficient way of computing the correlation matrix?




TODO
----
  
  * function for automatic zoom in waveformview as a function of
    channels and clusters
    
  * keyboard shortcuts for probe/box rescaling in waveformview
    
  * cluster group renaming
  * featureview controller: buttons for channel up/down
  * small widget with text information (number of spikes, highlighted spikes...)
  * lightweight hdf5 text viewer
  * refactoring correlograms: put the actual computations outside dataio
  * put COLORMAP in the data holder and remove dependencies 
  * correlograms computation
  * factorize highlight logic in shaders  
  * cluster merge with button / M press
  * cluster split with button / S press
  * trace view
  * fetdim variable in controller widget (1 to ?)
  * lowlight: gray or original colors
  * transient recoloring
  * move data manager into templates, so that templates contain everything
  * force cleaning up of widgets upon closing
  * make sure the GUI work in IPython
